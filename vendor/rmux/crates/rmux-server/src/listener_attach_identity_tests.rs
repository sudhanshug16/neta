//! Issue #182, driven through the production listener: the first attach frame
//! must describe the peer the connection authenticated, and the listener must
//! carry that frame's title into the registration it performs afterwards.
//!
//! `handler_attach_tests::set_titles` builds an attach target itself and hands
//! it to a registration helper, so it pins the render and the dedup rule but
//! never reaches the connection loop. Replacing the listener's seed with `None`
//! or letting the render describe the server owner leaves those tests green.
//! Everything here goes the whole way: a real wire request, the real
//! authenticated peer, the real upgraded byte stream and the real registration.
