//! Final-sink proof for attached bracketed paste that arrives while a pane is
//! still starting.
//!
//! On Windows the initial ConPTY is created off the request path, so attached
//! input can reach `prepare_pane_input_write_with_encoding` before the pane has
//! a terminal. The typed `DeferredInitialPaneInput::BracketedPaste` entry and
//! the console branch of `flush_deferred_initial_pane_input` exist so the paste
//! keeps its bracketed intent across that boundary. The queued-variant test in
//! `pane_terminals/deferred_initial/tests.rs` stops at the enum; these run a
//! real child and compare the bytes it read after the flush.
//!
//! Nothing here stamps the transcript. `append_bytes_to_pane_transcript_for_test`
//! would let the pane look bracket-aware before any child existed, which proves
//! only that a synthetic mode selects a route: the test would stay green even if
//! real child output never published the capability during startup. Instead the
//! pane is held at the production boundary where its child is already running
//! and publishing output while the pane is still in `Starting`, and the mode is
//! read from the production transcript inside that window.
//!
//! The aware and unaware panes pin the observation from both sides. If the
//! capability were never observed, the aware proof could not reach bracketed
//! mode; if it were assumed rather than observed, the unaware child would
//! receive delimiters it never advertised.
