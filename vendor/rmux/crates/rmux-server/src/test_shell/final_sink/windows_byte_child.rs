//! Builds the Windows final-sink pane child from pinned Rust source.
//!
//! The child cannot be this test binary re-executed: putting the pane console
//! into raw mode needs FFI and the crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The
//! previous child was therefore a PowerShell script that re-implemented the
//! historical probe's read boundary by hand — which is precisely what left the
//! R1 diagnostic ambiguous, because a hand-written `ReadConsoleW` loop has no
//! demonstrated equivalent for the standard library's request sizing,
//! incomplete-UTF-8 buffering, partial returns or unpaired-surrogate rejection.
//!
//! So the child is the real thing instead: [`CHILD_MAIN_SOURCE`] hands
//! `std::io::stdin().lock()` to [`super::byte_observer`], and both files are
//! written out and compiled with the workspace-pinned toolchain the first time a
//! slot needs a child. `OBSERVER_SOURCE` is `include_str!` of the very module
//! this test binary compiles and drives, so the observer the harness asserts on
//! and the observer the child runs are the same bytes by construction.
//!
//! # Why every build is fresh and private
//!
//! The whole value of this child is that the R1 A/B can say *which* observer it
//! measured. The build this replaces cached the executable under a predictable
//! shared path and returned it whenever `rmux-final-sink-child.exe` there
//! happened to be a file — so a stale, half-installed or deliberately planted
//! executable was executed as the pinned child, and the diagnostic would have
//! reported on whatever that was.
//!
//! A path is not provenance, and neither is anything stored beside an
//! executable: a file the harness does not control cannot vouch for a file the
//! harness does not control. The correction is therefore not a stronger cache
//! but no cache at all. Each process compiles its own child into a directory it
//! created exclusively, never adopting an existing one, and [`OnceLock`] is an
//! in-process compile-once guard over *that* build rather than a way to reuse
//! another process's work.
//!
//! # What one build retains
//!
//! Beside the executable, in the directory the build owns:
//!
//! | File               | Meaning                                              |
//! |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `byte_observer.rs` | the observer bytes `rustc` was given                 |
//! | `main.rs`          | the generated child bytes `rustc` was given          |
//! | `rustc-program.txt`| the one resolved compiler value, displayed and exact |
//! | `rustc-argv.txt`   | the complete compilation argv, as invoked            |
//! | `rustc-identity.txt`| `rustc -vV` from that same value                    |
//! | `source-identity.txt`| the informational source digest and byte counts    |
//!
//! The retained sources *are* the compilation inputs — `rustc` is pointed at
//! this `main.rs`, not at a copy — so an A/B compares the executable against the
//! bytes that produced it and cannot be shown a file that drifted from them.
//! The digest is recorded so two hosts can say they built the same source; it
//! never authorises reusing anything.
