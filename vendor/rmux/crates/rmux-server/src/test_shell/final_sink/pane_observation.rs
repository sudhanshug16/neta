//! What the production transcript had observed when a final-sink proof stopped
//! waiting for its child's own bracketed-paste announcement.
//!
//! Both final-sink siblings hold their pane at the same precondition: the child
//! writes `ESC[?2004h` to its own terminal, the server's transcript parses it,
//! and only then is the pane's mode the production answer to whether this
//! destination is bracketed-paste aware. Nothing may stamp that mode; waiting
//! for it *is* the proof that a real child published the capability.
//!
//! When the wait expires the proof is over, but the diagnosis has to start. The
//! wait used to report only that the mode was never reached, which is the same
//! sentence for a pane that received nothing at all, a pane that received output
//! carrying no announcement, and a pane whose console deposited the
//! announcement as screen text instead of interpreting it as a sequence. Two
//! Windows 10 release executions, each behind a thirteen-minute compilation,
//! produced exactly that sentence and could not say which of those had
//! happened.
//!
//! Everything here is read from production state — the transcript's
//! applied-output count, its screen mode, its cursor and its rendered screen —
//! so the failure names the boundary the announcement stopped at instead of only
//! the deadline that expired. It observes; it never establishes.
