//! A real pane child that persists the bytes its application actually read.
//!
//! Every other bracketed-paste suite in this crate observes
//! `RawPaneInputProbe`, which short-circuits
//! `prepare_pane_input_write_with_encoding` to `PaneInputSink::CapturedForTest`
//! *before* the starting-pane queue and *before* the Windows passthrough/legacy
//! sink selection. Those probes stay green when the legacy console sink is
//! bypassed, so they cannot close the `AttachInput::bytes -> ... -> real child
//! application bytes` obligation.
//!
//! A slot is a directory the harness and the child exchange files through:
//!
//! | File       | Written by | Meaning                                        |
//! |------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
//! | `ready`    | child      | terminal is raw and the read is starting        |
//! | `out.part` | child      | the capture so far, grown as bytes arrive       |
//! | `out`      | child      | the complete application-side capture           |
//! | `error`    | child      | a step failed, with the reason that step gives  |
//! | `stop`     | harness    | the child may leave its keep-alive park         |
//! | `done`     | child      | the child left its park, so teardown is over    |
//!
//! Only the child's own files are evidence that a child ran. `stop` is written
//! by the harness, so reading it back would make teardown believe in a child
//! for every slot it ever touched.
//!
//! `out` means *complete*: both children create it only by renaming an
//! `out.part` that already holds exactly the expected byte count, and any
//! failure keeps `out.part` and writes `error` instead. A reported `error`
//! therefore outranks everything the harness might otherwise infer from a
//! file's presence.
//!
//! `out.part` is what makes a mutation red readable. A mutation that routes a
//! bracketed paste back through the delimiter-consuming legacy path leaves the
//! child twelve bytes short forever; without a growing partial file the only
//! observable would be a timeout indistinguishable from reader starvation.
//! With one, the failure names the exact bytes that arrived and the first
//! offset at which they diverge.
//!
//! The child must read from a *raw* terminal: a cooked console or PTY line
//! discipline treats the paste's leading `ESC` as an editing command and
//! rewrites CR/LF, so the captured bytes would say nothing about the sink. The
//! crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, so the child cannot be this test binary
//! re-executed — the Windows console-mode change needs FFI.
//!
//! Unix therefore uses `/bin/sh`, which [`super`] already exists to build, and
//! Windows uses a small pinned Rust program: its read boundary is the whole
//! point of the R1 diagnostic, so it is the historical
//! `stdin().lock().read(&mut [0_u8; 4096])` itself rather than an emulation of
//! it. See [`byte_observer`] and [`windows_byte_child`].
