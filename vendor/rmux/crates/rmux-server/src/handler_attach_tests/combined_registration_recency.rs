//! Combined M9 + M39: the three registration-side places where a *sizing*
//! order and a *session recency* order meet and must not be confused.
//!
//! M9 owns `ActiveAttach::size_sequence` — which attached client is the newest
//! sizing authority for a window. M39 owns `Session`'s `SessionRecency` — which
//! session was most recently used. They are allocated by different counters,
//! stored in different places, and answer different questions. Every test here
//! moves one and pins the other.
//!
//! `SessionRecency`'s allocator is a process-wide `static`, so parallel tests
//! mint tokens too; nothing below compares an absolute value or a global delta.
