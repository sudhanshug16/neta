//! `switch-client` frames the target with the status of the session the client
//! is *joining*, never the one it is leaving.
//!
//! tmux 3.7b's `cmd_switch_client_exec` assigns `c->session = s` before it calls
//! `recalculate_sizes()` and `server_redraw_client(c)`, and all three happen
//! inside the command's own execution. A client migrating between two aliases of
//! one linked window therefore votes exactly once — under the session it joins —
//! and the very first frame it receives is already drawn at that geometry.
//!
//! Measured against the pinned tmux 3.7b (binary sha256 `eb05f981…`, the
//! `frozen_reference.yaml` build) on macOS 26.5.2 arm64. `alpha:0` is linked into
//! `beta:1`, `beta` shows the alias, one real 100x40 PTY client migrates from
//! `alpha` to `beta`, and the geometry is read from the window as soon as
//! `switch-client` returns:
//!
//! ```text
//! source  target  window-size  at switch  settled
//! 2       off     smallest     100x40     100x40
//! 2       off     largest      100x40     100x40
