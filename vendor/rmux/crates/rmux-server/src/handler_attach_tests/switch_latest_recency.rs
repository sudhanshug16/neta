//! A client that switches into a window becomes that window's newest sizing
//! authority, and the frame it receives is the geometry the window keeps.
//!
//! tmux 3.7b's `cmd_switch_client_exec` assigns `s->curw->window->latest = c`
//! and only then calls `recalculate_sizes()`, so under `window-size latest` the
//! moving client outranks every client that was already there — including one
//! that attached after it. rmux selects the same answer for the frame it sends,
//! but the recency it selected with has to be the recency the moving client's
//! registration then *carries*: the very next reconcile of the same linked
//! family re-derives the winner from `active_attach`, and a registration still
//! holding its original arrival order loses to the resident client again.
//!
//! Measured against the pinned tmux 3.7b (`tmux -V` → `3.7b`, this Mac's build
//! of source `e802909d…`, binary sha256 `5bfe78e4…`) on macOS 26.5.2 arm64,
//! 2026-08-01. `alpha:0` is linked into `beta:1`, `grouped` is a grouped alias
//! of `beta` showing the same window, every session has `status off`, a 120x50
//! PTY client attaches to `alpha`, a *later* 100x40 PTY client attaches to
//! `beta`, and the 120x50 client then switches to `beta`:
//!
//! ```text
//! window-size  before   at switch  settled  alpha:0  beta:1  grouped:1
//! latest       100x40   120x50     120x50   120x50   120x50  120x50
//! largest      120x50   120x50     120x50   120x50   120x50  120x50
//! smallest     100x40   100x40     100x40   100x40   100x40  100x40
//! manual       80x24    80x24      80x24    80x24    80x24   80x24
//! ```
//!
//! Both clients stay attached to `beta` afterwards, at 120x50 and 100x40. The
//! `manual` row is the geometry the sessions were created with — 80x24 in the
//! oracle, `CLIENT_SIZE` here — because `manual` never resizes at all.
//!
//! The same probe measured the client switching to the session it is *already*
//! on: `before=100x40`, `settled=120x50` across all three aliases, so tmux's
//! assignment is unconditional and is not a side effect of changing session.
//!
//! Probe and log: `.rmux-audit/m9-latest/oracle_latest_switch.py`,
//! `oracle-latest-switch.log`.
