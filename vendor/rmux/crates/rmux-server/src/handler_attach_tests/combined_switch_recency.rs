//! Combined M9 + M39: what one attached session switch does to the two
//! independent orders it now touches at once.
//!
//! Neither isolated chain could measure this. M9's `fcedd32f` removed the
//! pre-switch `resize_session_for_attach_client` call for a client that already
//! holds an attach registration, so `commit_attached_session_switch` owns the
//! whole move. That removed call site also carried a `session.touch_attached()`
//! — under M39 a *session recency* mint. The credit that survives is the one
//! inside the commit's own `mutate_session_and_resize_window_terminal` closure,
//! which predates both chains.
//!
//! Two consequences follow, and only a combined tree can show them:
//!
//! * a successful attached switch credits its destination once, at the commit,
//!   and never before it;
//! * a switch that fails credits nothing at all, because the only remaining
//!   credit sits inside the transaction that rolls back.
//!
//! The second is a deliberate behaviour change relative to both isolated
//! chains and is pinned here rather than discovered later.
//!
//! `SessionRecency` is an opaque process-local token and the allocator behind
//! it is a process-wide `static`, so parallel tests mint tokens too. Every
//! assertion below therefore compares one session against *its own* earlier
//! token, never against an absolute value or a global delta.
