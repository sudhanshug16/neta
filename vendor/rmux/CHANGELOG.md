# Changelog

## 0.10.0

### SDK

- Add capability-gated `Pane::recover_output()` and `Pane::surface_stream()`.
  Raw recovery emits authoritative in-band rebases after lag, resize, parser
  expiry, history clearing, terminal reset, and process-generation changes.
  Each rebase always retains the validated viewport, includes the newest whole
  scrollback rows that fit its transport budget, and reports scrollback and
  metadata completeness explicitly.
  Surface updates are self-contained and share one lazy daemon-side projection
  per pane.
- Move `render_stream()` onto the shared surface projection while retaining
  legacy lag notices and cancellation-safe in-flight cursor polling.

### Web sharing

- Capture WebShare pane state and its live cursor at one atomic output boundary,
  then materialize recovery data outside the output-state lock.
- Apply one fragmentation-safe policy across snapshot and live bytes. Visual
  OSC commands remain available; OSC 52, unknown OSC commands, APC, DCS, PM,
  and SOS strings are removed. Kitty graphics and SIXEL are therefore not part
  of the WebShare pane data plane.

### Protocol

- Begin the 0.10 release line by moving detached RPC from wire version 5 to wire
  version 8 for pane streams, complete surface metadata, and display-message
  client controls. Wire versions 6 and 7 were unreleased candidates and are
  rejected. An already-running pre-0.10 daemon must be restarted before a
  0.10.0 client can connect.
- Make the public `Request` and `Response` envelopes non-exhaustive. Downstream
  matches now require a fallback arm, so future capability-gated additions
  cannot silently become source-breaking patch updates.

### Compatibility

- Render `display-popup` content as terminal output instead of status-format
  text. A popup process keeps the colours and attributes it emits, including
  basic, indexed, and 24-bit colour, and `-s` now colours only the cells the
  process left unstyled.

### Reliability and performance

- Linearize pane generation, output sequence, invalidation revision, transcript
  capture, and observer registration. Mutations without output bytes now wake
  recoverable consumers, and child exit remains lifecycle rather than logical
  pane removal.
- Coalesce no-op resize storms before the atomic critical section, keep
  notification outside locks, reserve subscription quota before capture, and
  keep the existing output publish path free of surface rendering.
- Validate raw recovery against a pinned independent xterm.js oracle, including
  scrollback, wrapped rows, alternate-screen state, custom tab stops, saved
  cursor/rendition state, and fragmented parser input.

### Remaining boundaries

- Pane streams synchronize bounded live state; they are not a durable event
  store.
- WebShare intentionally omits terminal graphics protocols carried by APC or
  DCS until a bounded, independently testable browser contract exists.

## 0.9.1

### Security

- Revalidate `server-access` authority during attach and control registration
  and throughout detached prompts, menus, mode trees, display-panes actions,
  and delayed callbacks. Keep Unix transport permissions synchronized with ACL
  changes and socket rebinding.
- Scope OSC 52 query replies to their originating attach generation so a late
  or timed-out reply cannot satisfy a later clipboard request.
- Reject Windows batch scripts in structured argv mode, where `cmd.exe` cannot
  preserve arbitrary argument boundaries.

### SDK

- Pin composite pane operations to stable pane ids across reindexing and moves,
  and retain in-flight render work across cancelled `next()` calls until the
  final update is delivered.

### Compatibility

- Route `get-clipboard` queries through eligible attached clients and preserve
  multiline Windows bracketed-paste framing, including short LF, Tab, and
  Backspace bursts and batches separated by console key noise.
- Render pane scrollbars and copy-mode line-number gutters, including their
  pane geometry, mouse hit-testing, styles, and mode-tree integration.
- Apply repeated target precedence before lookup, accept repeated idempotent
  top-level flags, resolve sourced targets against live state, and implement
  `list-windows -a` across sessions.
- Correct float comparison precision, focus-follows-mouse, linked-window pane
  selection and mutation, lifecycle hook dispatch, and final-window removal.
- Keep keyboard copy-mode selections anchored at the keyboard cursor when
  mouse mode is enabled; only commands originating from a mouse event consume
  mouse coordinates.
- Drop cached mouse coordinates when a background `run-shell` or `if-shell`
  queue starts instead of reviving the event that launched it.
- Keep `if-shell -F` synchronous when `-b` is also present, preserving its
  inline output and command context like tmux 3.7b.
- Keep detached RPC wire version 5 unchanged across the 0.9 release line.

### Reliability

- Make special-file buffer I/O cancellable, handle empty-writer FIFOs on macOS,
  and restore private or custom Unix sockets safely at startup and after
  `SIGUSR1`.
- Join accepted daemon tasks and tracked status-job process trees during
  shutdown, including the task-registration race.
- Fence and reset Windows terminal input around exclusive terminal actions.
- Pin guarded delayed and interactive actions to the exact client, session,
  window-link occurrence, pane, or pane-output generation they captured.
  This covers queued `rename-window` and `kill-pane`, `new-window` placement,
  mode trees, `display-panes`, menus, and popups. Other queued mutations keep
  their existing targeting semantics.
- Preserve command-error hooks and targeted `run-shell` output across queue
  capture, retain deferred lifecycle targets through normal and special
  command paths, and keep nested command futures stack-safe.
- Keep attached lock actions scoped to the intended client and session while
  allowing the same attach registration to follow an explicit session switch.

### Packaging

- Discover the private helper under `lib/rmux/libexec` for prefix-based Unix
  layouts (contributed by @BarbUk).

### Remaining boundaries

- Under retention pressure, very large attached input can be split into
  multiple self-contained bracketed-paste envelopes.
- Terminal behavior on older ConPTY builds and some SSH hosts remains
  host-dependent. Descendants that deliberately escape their tracked Unix
  process group remain outside shutdown containment.
- The non-advertised 1.0 command surface remains deferred, including floating
  panes, `new-pane`, the remaining split and `refresh-client` flags, tree-mode
  preview styling, and the complete Kitty Keyboard Protocol.

## 0.9.0

### Security

- Authenticate Windows named-pipe servers against the expected user SID,
  integrity level, and canonical pipe name.
- Bound pre-authentication, terminal parser, input, queue, and outbound backlog
  resources so malformed or stalled clients fail closed.
- Own helper processes through Unix process groups or Windows Job Objects and
  clean them up during shutdown, replacement, and failed startup.

### SDK

- Add pane option APIs, revisioned pane-state streams, foreground process
  snapshots, explicit argv or shell process specs, and stable pane identities.
- Resolve index-based pane handles through visible coordinates while retaining
  stable pane ids across base-index and pane-base-index changes.
- Preserve armed wait, cancellation, lifecycle, and ownership semantics across
  reconnects and pane respawns.

### Compatibility

- Expand the tmux 3.7b compatibility surface across command parsing,
  source-file handling, formats, hooks, control mode, copy mode, targets, and
  queued commands.
- Honor default-command, caller working directories, pane-base-index, key
  tables, and detached split semantics consistently across CLI, SDK, bindings,
  and sourced commands.
- Improve startup config compatibility, including nested includes, BOM and CRLF
  handling, aliases, assignments, and the gpakosz configuration corpus.
- Report RMUX in XTVERSION product identification rather than a
  tmux release.
- Disable incomplete Kitty keyboard negotiation while retaining supported
  xterm modifyOtherKeys behavior.
- Improve OSC colour and clipboard handling, Windows bracketed paste, outer
  mouse reporting, and root mouse binding sequences.
- Preserve control-mode framing and finite accepted work after input EOF while
  cancelling operations that could wait indefinitely.

### Reliability

- Harden Windows shell startup, attach recovery, console input, daemon
  breakaway, native upgrades, and package rollback.
- Stabilize pane journals, hook ordering, leases, queued background jobs,
  terminal reflow, attach transitions, and multi-client output isolation.
- Make Unix socket startup and cleanup reliable for relative socket paths,
  daemon churn, and exit-empty behavior.
- Bump the detached RPC frame envelope from wire version 3 to 5. Clients and
  SDKs throughout the 0.9 release line use wire version 5, and an
  already-running pre-0.9 server must be restarted during upgrade.

### Packaging

- Preserve the complete Windows dispatcher and private runtime layout in
  archives and installer upgrades (contributed by @isacgalvao).
- Add deterministic release baselines and cross-platform package, resource,
  protocol, and runtime gates.
- Keep the root `rmux` crate installable with
  `cargo install rmux --locked`.

## 0.8.0

### Security

- Escaped control-mode window and paste-buffer names before emitting
  notifications, preventing injected control frames from newline-bearing names.
- Rejected overflowing and non-minimal varint frame lengths in the protocol
  decoder while preserving the existing minimal encoder output.
- Preserved UTF-8 character boundaries when truncating WebSocket close reasons.
- Capped negative format padding widths before allocation to avoid pathological
  padding requests.
- Disabled persisted GitHub checkout credentials in the release workflow.

### Reliability

- Added panic-safe connection cleanup so subscriptions and SDK waits are removed
  even if a connection task unwinds.
- Gated two-phase SDK wait armed acknowledgements behind an explicit
  `sdk.waits.armed` capability and kept dropped SDK waits from blocking the
  shared transport.
- Hardened Windows Ctrl-C delivery for attached clients and `send-keys` so
  foreground console programs such as Python and `ping.exe` receive native
  interrupts while raw-mode console applications still receive Ctrl-C bytes.
- Moved blocking Windows console attach writes behind a dedicated output queue
  and cleared QuickEdit when entering raw mode so paused console output does not
  freeze input forwarding.
- Routed multi-token Windows `send-keys` sequences containing `C-c`, such as
  `send-keys C-c Enter`, through the native Ctrl-C path instead of falling back
  to a raw `0x03` byte.
- Added a Unix archive installer that preserves the tiny/full `bin` and
  `libexec` layout and installs the public tiny binary last during upgrades.
- Made `rmux claude install-skill` back up existing user skills before
  replacing them, while refusing to overwrite symlinks.
- Made connection subscription/wait cleanup tolerate poisoned cleanup locks.
- Spawned popup waiters before popup readers so popup children are reaped even
  if reader setup fails.
- Relaxed the Windows ConPTY Ctrl-D timeout smoke when the host leaves
  `timeout.exe` running, preserving coverage without failing on runner-specific
  behavior.
- Resolved tiny CLI helpers through canonical executable paths, covering
  portable aliases such as WinGet Links while keeping packaged layouts first.
- Resolved hidden daemon siblings through canonical executable paths so portable
  aliases can cold-start the packaged daemon directly.
- Resolved SDK daemon candidates from installed `rmux` binaries before falling
  back to PATH names, avoiding extra tiny-helper hops in portable layouts.

### Compatibility

- Matched tmux `source-file -n -v` behavior for implicit-target commands such
  as `clear-history`, keeping parse-only diagnostics usable on public tmux
  configurations.
- Reported missing optional nested config files sourced through the tmux shim as
  plain client messages instead of startup `config error:` diagnostics, matching
  tmux-style fallback config workflows such as oh-my-tmux.
- Matched tmux 3.4 missing-path `source-file` diagnostics (`<path>: No such
  file or directory`) and let a later successful queued `run-shell` clear an
  earlier non-zero source-file status.
- Routed public clients launched from RMUX panes through RMUX-owned inherited
  `$TMUX` socket paths, while still ignoring foreign tmux sockets, so nested
  `rmux has-session` and `new-session -A` target the calling pane's server.
- Restored sparse-map deserialization defaults for `NewSessionExtRequest` and
  related request types without changing the bincode wire layout.
- Added a defensive `with-session` empty-command guard before lease creation.
- Restored tmux 3.4-compatible binary boolean format semantics for `&&:` and
  `||:`; use nested boolean formats for portable multi-operand conditions.
- Matched tmux 3.4 expression-format arithmetic for empty operands, `0x`
  integer literals, and integer divide-by-zero sentinel results covered by the
  0.8 compatibility gate.
- Matched tmux 3.4 substitution-format behavior for empty and zero-width
  regex patterns, avoiding synthetic insertions that tmux leaves untouched.
- Matched tmux control-mode escaping for DEL and fixed HEAD responses to omit
  bodies.
- Corrected `input-buffer-size` validation and rejected bare non-boolean choice
  toggles such as `set -g mode-keys`.
- Added `Display` and `Error` implementations for `StartServerError`, and
  corrected public split-direction documentation.
- Shared detected client terminal features between the full and tiny attach
  paths, including Windows Terminal rendering and input capabilities.
- Improved SDK and CLI daemon startup diagnostics when no daemon binary can be
  found or a hidden daemon exits before creating its endpoint.
- Matched tmux `resize-pane` precedence for repeated relative directions and
  composed absolute `-x`/`-y` dimensions with later relative adjustments across
  CLI, tiny, and `source-file` paths.
- Matched tmux 3.4 `join-pane`/`move-pane` legacy `-p` handling: bare
  `-p` reports `size missing`, while `-p`/`-p50` paired with `-l` is accepted
  as a compatibility modifier and preserves the explicit `-l` size.
- Matched tmux pane-transfer defaults across CLI and `source-file` paths:
  `join-pane`, `move-pane`, and `swap-pane` now fall back from `{marked}` to
  the current pane when `-s` is omitted, and same-window `join-pane`/`move-pane`
  apply `-l` sizing to the same side of the split as tmux.
- Preserved tmux `swap-pane -d` active-pane behavior when the active pane is
  neither the source nor the target pane.
- Aligned pane lifecycle hooks with tmux by firing `pane-exited` for natural
  pane exits while no longer synthesizing it for `kill-pane`/`respawn-pane -k`,
  and by avoiding synthetic `pane-focus-in`/`pane-focus-out` hooks on detached
  `select-pane` changes.
- Aligned stable pane-id SDK/Web kill and respawn paths with the CLI by no
  longer synthesizing `pane-exited` for explicit `kill-pane` or
  `respawn-pane -k` operations.
- Preserved coalesced `pane-title-changed` notifications when title changes are
  batched with activity or bell alerts for the same pane.
- Parsed compact queued `set-hook`/`show-hooks` flag clusters such as `-ga` and
  `-gpR` in tmux config/source-file paths.
- Bumped the detached RPC frame envelope to wire version 3 and refreshed the
  compatibility fixtures so stale v1/v2 frames are rejected explicitly. This is
  an intentional 0.8 line boundary: restart 0.7.x daemons after upgrading, and
  run 0.8 SDK/client binaries against 0.8 daemons.
- Preserved pending `DoubleClick1Pane` dispatch when a later mouse event arrives
  after the click timeout but before the async timer task runs.
- Restored tmux 3.4 root mouse bindings for pager/alternate-screen copy
  interactions by removing the non-tmux `alternate_on` branch from
  `MouseDrag1Pane`, `MouseDown2Pane`, `WheelUpPane`, `DoubleClick1Pane`, and
  `TripleClick1Pane`.
- Parsed compact queued `display-message` clusters such as `-pt target` the same
  way as tmux, fixing source-file and binding commands that combine print and
  target flags.
- Rejected extra `display-message` message operands in both CLI and queued
  `source-file` paths instead of silently joining them.
- Consumed bracketed paste while a pane is in copy-mode instead of leaking the
  pasted payload into the underlying PTY.

### CI

- Bumped release-facing versions to `0.8.0` across Cargo workspace metadata,
  `Cargo.lock`, the manpage, snap metadata, README download links, and localized
  README files.
- Serialized the Windows attach/control-key integration probe group under
  nextest and extended the Windows Ctrl matrix smoke script to exercise
  multi-token `send-keys C-c Enter`.
- Hardened the Windows Ctrl matrix `send-keys` harness so single-token controls
  such as `C-a` and `Escape` are passed as native command arguments rather than
  as literal probe text.
- Added a Windows package smoke that exercises portable alias fallback, PATH
  resolution, and daemon startup from a WinGet-like Links layout.
- Exposed `rmux-daemon` in the Scoop manifest and expanded package-manager
  metadata smokes to cover the installed daemon path.
- Added reusable installed-package smokes that force the tiny helper fallback
  before exercising daemon startup.
- Extended Unix archive verification to install the archive into a temporary
  prefix and smoke the installed `bin/rmux` through its packaged helper.
- Added release-gate coverage for `rmux-server --lib` and SDK wait-cancellation
  regressions so deterministic red tests cannot pass through review-only gates.

## 0.7.1

  `Cargo.lock`, the manpage, snap metadata, README download links, and localized
  README files.
- Added a Windows package smoke that exercises portable alias fallback, PATH

## 0.7.0

- Added the tiny public CLI package layout for hot detached commands, with the
  full canonical CLI installed as a private libexec helper for complex paths.
- Added direct tiny CLI paths for common operations including session creation,
  split/resize, capture, display-message, send-keys, source-file, list-sessions,
  and kill-server, while preserving helper fallback for unsupported forms.
- Added `RMUX_DISABLE_TINY_CLI=1` as an operational kill switch for reverting to
  the full CLI helper when diagnosing tiny-path compatibility issues.
- Improved detached command performance and release benchmarking discipline with
  baseline metadata, perf-diff tooling, and release-review smoke gates for the
  tiny package layout.
- Added additive protocol variants and capabilities for target-action and
  capture fast paths while keeping legacy wire variants available.
- Hardened tmux compatibility for repeated short flags, queue separators, tiny
  error surfaces, source-file exit status, and mutating target-action retry
  safety.
- Updated release packaging, snap metadata, manpage/version surfaces, and
  localized download references for `v0.7.0`.

## 0.6.5

- Added release artifacts for `linux-aarch64` alongside the existing Linux,
  macOS, and Windows archives.
- Added Sigstore keyless signing for `SHA256SUMS` and GitHub build provenance
  attestations for release assets. The documented provenance level is SLSA Build
  Level 2.
- Updated release documentation, direct-download filenames, and package-manager
  examples for `v0.6.5`.
- Added APT repository metadata for both `amd64` and `arm64` Debian packages.
- Declared the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime dependency in Windows package
  manager metadata for MSVC release builds.
- Hardened incomplete terminal parser input and SDK line-stream buffering
  against unbounded growth.

## 0.6.1

- Published the first patch release in the 0.6 line with the 0.6.0 feature set
  and release packaging/documentation fixes.

## 0.6.0

- Added the typed Rust SDK surface for session, window, pane, snapshot, locator,
  expectation, stream, and web-share automation workflows.
- Added `capabilities` discovery output for SDK and scripting clients.
- Added hybrid post-quantum, end-to-end encrypted `web-share` for pane and
  session sharing through a static browser frontend.
- Added generated shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, and
  Elvish without moving the tmux-compatible runtime parser to clap subcommands.
- Hardened web-share backpressure handling with atomic session keyframes,
  prioritized control frames, protocol capability negotiation, and pane scroll
  patching.
- Bumped the detached daemon wire protocol to v2. Existing v0.5.x daemons must
  be restarted after upgrading clients to v0.6.0.
- Improved tmux compatibility across command parsing, target resolution,
  copy-mode, resize/layout behavior, options, hooks, list-keys, and JSON output.
- Kept product semantics where tmux-compatible behavior would copy known tmux
  bugs. RMUX keeps exact-zero `if-shell -F` truthiness, saturating integer
  format arithmetic, strict invalid capture bounds, and literal trailing `#`
  format text.
- Kept RMUX-native foreground `run-shell` stdout forwarding and raw attached
  input byte preservation, rather than copying tmux behaviors that hide command
  output or drop malformed/non-UTF-8 input bytes.
- Removed unsupported tmux-incompatible parser extensions from listing commands,
  including `list-keys -r`, `list-clients -r`, and list buffer/client sort flags.
- Removed the earlier rmux-only multi-pair conditional format extension; use
  nested conditionals for portable configuration.
- Fixed native attach render coalescing so full repaint frames are latest-wins
  without starving the terminal under continuous output.
- Fixed OSC52 passthrough delivery races for native attached clients.
- Fixed client environment propagation for unset tombstones and non-UTF-8
  process environment values.
- Kept `rmux -V` branded as `rmux 0.6.0`; use `rmux diagnose --json` for build
  and platform diagnostics.

## 0.5.0

- Initial public release of RMUX as a tmux-compatible Rust terminal multiplexer
  with Unix and Windows daemon/client support.
